# Fuel Cells

Fuel cells are similar to batteries; they have a cathode, electrolyte and anode.

![Fuel cell schematic](./images/fuel_cell_schematic.svg# w-50pct relative l-3-12th)

Electricity can be generated as long as fuel is supplied (they don't need to be recharged)

# Fuel cell fundamentals

$$
\ce{ {Fuel} + O2 -> H2O + nCO2}
$$

- Fuel cells grouped into *low-temperature* (LT, < 200 &deg;C) and *high-temperature* (HT, > 450 &deg;C). 

- H<sub>2</sub> is the preferred fuel 
	- Particularly for LT devices.
	- Doesn't produce CO<sub>2</sub>
--

- Other fuels (*e.g.* CH<sub>3</sub>OH, CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>) also possible
	- Steam reforming reaction converts fuels to $\ce{H2}$:
	$$\ce{CH4 + H2O ->[>700 ^{\circ}C] CO + 3H2}$$
		- can be achieved in-situ for HT cells, but must be separate for LT.

# Fuel cell efficiency

Fuel cells are *very* efficient
- Convert fuel &rarr; electricity directly, rather than <br> 
fuel &rarr; heat &rarr; electricity (as in combustion)

$$
\text{Thermodynamic efficiency} = \frac{\Delta G}{\Delta H}
$$

*e.g.* for $ \ce{2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O} \ (\Delta H = -571.6\ \text{kJ mol}^{-1})$:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Cathode:} & & \ce{4H+ + O2 + 4e- &-> 2H2O & & E} = +1.229 \mathrm{\ V} \\\\
\text{Anode:} & & \ce{4H+ + 4e- &<- 2H2} & & E = 0.00 \mathrm{\ V} \\\\
\end{align}
$$
--
$$
\begin{align}
\Delta G &= -nFE \\\\
         &= -4 \times F \times 1.229 \\\\
		 &= -474.3 \mathrm{\ kJ\ mol^{-1}} \qquad (\mathrm{per\ mole\ O_2})
\end{align}
$$
--
Efficiency = &eta; = -474.3 / 571.6 = **83%**

class: compact
# Efficiency with temperature

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S, \quad
\therefore \quad
\frac{\Delta G}{\Delta H} = \eta = 1 - \frac{T \Delta S}{\Delta H}
$$

--

For 'ideal' combustion engine (heat engine) the maximum efficiency is the Carnot limit:
- $ \eta = \frac{T\_{\mathrm{hot}} - T\_{\mathrm{cold}}}{T\_{\mathrm{hot}}} $

A heat engine is one that converts heat into work, for instance by repeatedly heating and cooling a substance while extracting (usually 
mechanical) motion. The term covers a huge range of technologies including combustion engines, thermal power stations and fridges (a heat pump, 
which is a heat engine operating in reverse).

A really nice example (in which the heating/cooling is done on a sealed chamber of air) is the Stirling engine:

# PEMFC + Methanol

Methanol easier to store/transport than H<sub>2</sub>
- Readily oxidised, does not require C-C bond breaking

$$

\text{Overall:} & & \ce{ CH3OH + \frac{3}{2}O2 &-> CO2 + 2H2O} & & E= 1.183\mathrm{\ V}
\end{align}
$$
![PEMFC fuel cell](./images/PEMFC.jpg# db fr w-3-12th)

### Problems
- MeOH crosses from anode to cathode  .red[&#10008;]
	- Reduces cell voltage to ~0.5 V
- CO formed in side-reaction, blocking reaction sites  .red[&#10008;]
	- requires more Pt catalyst!

- High temperature allows internal steam reforming; many fuels
- No precious metal catalysts
- Excess heat can be used to increase efficiency (to ~90%)
	- drive an electricity turbine or combined heat and power (CHP)

# SOFC Limitations

High temperatures:
- prevent rapid start/stop
- cause reactivity between electrolyte and electrodes
- make thermal expansion important

--

Delicate balance between:
- optimum temperature for redox and/or ionic conductivity
- thermal expansion, reactivity and device construction
- Intermediate-temperature (IT) SOFCs are the current optimum.

Ionic Conductivity | High | High | High
Chemical stability | reducing conditions | oxidising **and** reducing conditions | oxidising conditions

# 'Perfect' electrodes

Ideally, electrodes should be good electronic *and* ionic conductors!
- fuel/oxygen reactions would occur at the electrode surface

![Mixed conductor reaction sites](./images/triple_phase_boundary_mixedconductor.svg# w-third relative l-30pct) 

--

In reality, use a mixture of good ionic and electronic conductors.
- reactions occur at the **triple phase boundary**

# Typical anode materials

Usually a cermet (*i.e.* mixture) of Ni and electrolyte
- Ni &rarr; high e<sup>-</sup> conductivity and catalytic activity
	- but susceptible to poisoning by S (forming stable $\ce{NiS}$)
- High ionic conductivity from electrolyte

# Typical cathode materials

Composite of $\ce{La\_{1-x}Sr\_{x}MnO\_{3}}$ perovskite (LSMO) and electrolyte
- LSMO gives e<sup>-</sup> conduction and high catalytic activity
	- $\ce{Sr^{2+}}$ subtitution generates holes in valence band
- poor performance below 700 &deg;C .red[&#10008;]

# Improving Ionic conduction

As $\sigma = nq\mu$, so  as [defects] &uarr;, $\sigma$ &uarr;

*However*, at high defect concentrations we can get **defect clusters**
- Local ordering of defects reduces mobility

*e.g.* in YSZ:
$(\ce{(1-x)ZrO2 + \frac{x}{2}Y2O3 -> Y\_{x}Zr\_{1-x}O\_{2-\frac{x}{2}} })$

???

In YSZ, introducing two Yttrium atoms (x=2) results in the formation of one oxygen vacancy.
Locally, these are found to order; the optimum arrangement is for each OM<sub>4</sub> tetrahedron
to contain 2 Zr and 2 Y, with oxygen vacancies arranging in a 'grid-like'p pattern.

The figure (a) shows the the equilibrium arrangement for Y<sub>2</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (x = 0.5). 
Compare this with the ideal fluorite structure consisting of edge-sharing OM<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra, shown below:

# Lecture recap

- fuel cells operate like a battery with continous 'charge' supply
	- Many similar materials properties required
- different technologies work at different temperatures
	- advantages and disadvantages for both
- properties of electrolyte, cathode and anode must be optimised
- ideal electrodes would be ionically *and* electronically conducting
	- more commonly a mixture of materials is used
- Ionic conduction reaches a maximum with defect concentration
	- defect ordering occurs
- Defect ordering can give rise to new structure types
