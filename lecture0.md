# Getting started

Welcome to the Ionic Materials course. The lecture notes all display within a web browser* and can be accessed
from the [contents page](#overview). The video lectures are embedded within the notes and synchronised with each slide
for simplicity (and to allow you to easily take a break, rather than watch 50 minutes at once!).

If you have any problems with the presentations, please get in touch (james.cumby@ed.ac.uk)!

To continue, you can:
- get more information about [using the slides](#usage),
- learn about [interactive crystal structures](#jmol_use), or
- go directly to the [contents page](#overview).

# Using the slides

These slides are written using [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com/#1).
Detailed instructions to use the slideshows can be found by pressing <kbd>H</kbd>*, but to advanced through the slides in order
you can:
- type <kbd>&darr;</kbd>, <kbd>&rarr;</kbd>, <kbd>Pg Dn</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> on your keyboard
- Scroll using a mouse/touchpad
- Swipe on a touchscreen<sup>&dagger;</sup>

Some slides also contain additional notes or points of interest; to access these press <kbd>P</kbd>.

Move to the next slide to learn about [interactive structures](#jmol_use) or go to the [contents page](#overview).

# Interactive crystal structures

On some slides there are interactive crystal structures, allowing you to rotate and zoom the 3D models. These are created using [Jmol](http://wiki.jmol.org/index.php/Jmol_Tutorials).

To rotate the crystal model, left-click and drag around the image area (this can take some practice!). Other useful actions can be found [here](http://wiki.jmol.org/index.php/Mouse_Manual).
