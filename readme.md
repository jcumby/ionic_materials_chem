# Ionic Materials

This repository contains lecture notes for a 6-lecture advanced course in "Ionic Materials" at the University of Edinburgh.

The interactive notes can be viewed [on Github Pages](https://jcumby.github.io/ionic_materials_chem).

## Interactive Demonstrations

During the lectures there are a number of interactive demonstrations:

** Lecture 1 **
- Close packing and holes: use malteasers and polos to demonstrate close-packing (hat tip to Prof. Saiful Islam for this idea!)
- Using 3D-printed polyhedra to show octahedral and tetrahedral holes

** Lecture 2 **

- Numerous quizzes to test understanding

** Lecture 3 **

- Demonstration of vacancy ordering using blocks (introduced 2025-26)

** Lecture 4 **

- Demonstration involving balloons (and volunteers!) to show the difference between conversion and intercalation electrodes

** Lecture 5 **

- Demonstration of impedance of capacitor/resistor using people running around

** Lecture 6 **

- Demonstration with sheep and cows as defect clusters
