		Lecture improvements still to do...
===================================

2025-26
-------

## Lecture 1

- Good timing
- Don't spend time on the overview slides; the instructions are repeated in the L1 slides
- 3D octahedra too dark to show up. Tetrahedra helped, but remember to show them clearly before placing between octahedra
- Link between close-packing and octahedral felt a bit stilted. Is there a better way to show the relationship between the two?
- Most confusion was felt over oct/tet holes. Is there a better demonstration?
- Discussion of different structure types was a bit 'stamp collecting'.
	- Make sure to introduce the number of holes per CP ion first, and then progress to the different packings
	- Anion sizes are slightly too large to show holes and wavy plane in rutile

## Lecture 2

- Ran 2 minutes over; could have allowed less time for quiz 2 or earlier slides
- Incorrect colour in NaCl Schottky diagram
- When introducing BaTiO3 K-V quiz, make sure not to state it is vacancy formation!!
- Jump between BaTiO3 quiz and substitution section seemed odd. Need to smooth the transition
- Solid solution and non-stoichiometry sections were both rushed.
	- Could Vegard's law be introduced earlier to help with substitution explanation?
- Need to update references to 'defect ordering' (now in L3)

## Lecture 3

- Ran slightly over time (~ 30 seconds) but had to rush final slides
- Need to know the answers to the CeO2-x quix (first question) to write up defect equations without hesitation! Good balance of difficulty in the different materials, however.
- Videos of measuring conductivity felt slightly unnecessary and out of place. Are they required, or could they be better integrated to help the flow?
- Defect ordering fitted for time, but was not well-integrated. Can it be linked with conductivity pathways somehow?
- Colour-coding of atoms should be specified
- Is there a demonstration that could explain strain-driven defect ordering?  
- The demonstration with bottle caps wasn't overly successful; moving the block caused it to drift out of the field of view, and moving it back caused the caps to reorder. 
	- A strain-driven demo would be better, and link to the conductivity (i.e. moving ions).
- WO3 vacancy ordering still felt out of place, but introducing substitution ordering first definitely helped.
- Should there be mention of intrinsic vs extrinsic conduction? There is probably time with trimming elsewhere

## Lecture 4

- Ran slightly short (~2 mins)
- First part of lecture is still dry! 
- Could potentially expand the discussion of design principles for increasing operating voltage, with greater number of examples
- Need to emphasise the importance of mass in optimising for specific charge
- Link between "design rules" and electrode families was a bit weak
- Ballon demonstration worked, but challenging to get enough volunteers
- Need to be clear on anode vs cathode for conversion electrodes
	- Specify energy of each material in DOS-style diagram?
- Could add slide highlighting advantages/disadvantages of intercalation electrodes.
	- Need to be careful not to labour the point too much though, also for conversion electrodes
- Local vs average structure felt bolted-on.


## Lecture 5

- Ran to time
- Could have cut down initial slides (i.e. capacitor introduction)
- Slightly short on later sections, but not too much
- Limited audience participation, but demonstration still worked

## Lecture 6

- Overran by ~2 mins (even without defect ordering demo)
    - Could cut time in introduction and thermodynamics sections
- Top trumps worked well, and students struggled to answer later questions
    - Important to spend enough time going through the answers
- Defect ordering section felt like an afterthought
	- Would it be better to integrate that into L3 only, and use the cow/sheep demo in that lecture?

## Overall Improvements


2024-25
-------

## Lecture 1

- overran slightly, but only ~1 min
- Malteaser demo with larger number of polos worked well, just remember to dim the lights
- 3D octahedra too dark to show up, even with lights dimmed
	- Ideally, this needs 3D octahedra and tetrahedra that can attach to each other, demonstrating the packing and hole positions
	
## Lecture 2

- Overran, and needed to cover shear defects in lecture 3
- First KV question is very easy
	- Maybe include a second of intermediate difficulty before getting to the Mg2SiO4 question
- Shear phases are difficult to visualise (and don't easily fit in lecture 2 timing)
	- Can they be incorporated into lecture 3 or 6?

## Lecture 3

- Ran ~4 minutes short, even with plenty of time devoted to defect quiz
- It would be helpful to derive K-V equations for (some of) the defects in the quiz
	- Should shear phases be replaced by something else?
- !!! Use the extra time to mention the assessment !!!


## Lecture 4

- Ran slightly short (~3 mins? difficult to judge based on UG announcement at start)
- Remember to bring ANSWERS for battery capacity question!
- Balloon demonstration for conversion vs intercalation electrodes went well, but does it clarify anything?!
- Some parts may be too simple; need to focus more on structure-property analysis

## Lecture 5

- Overran by ~2 mins, and ferroelectric section was a bit rushed
- Most people answered the impedance question correctly
- Some people confused most during this lecture

## Lecture 6

- Feedback - would like a quiz?

	

2023-24
-------

**Lecture 1**
- Slightly rushed towards the end (although tried to end at 12:50 rather than 13:00). Needed to cover final two slides in lecture 2
- Demo with polos/malteasers collapsed after layer 2
- 3D printed octahedra nicely show face sharing, but black colour does not come out on doc cam
- Too much time spent on intro, not enough on hole filling

** Lecture 2**

- Ran to time (but only just)
- Need to be clearer on Quiz 2, i.e. why an interstitial proton does not form
    - Are there examples of interstitial protons in oxides, or do they always associate with an O2-?
- Need to work through Kroger-Vink notation more slowly
- Defect ordering and non-stoichiometry felt a bit like an after-thought...

** Lecture 3**

** Lecture 4**

[- Demonstration of conversion vs intercalation electrodes using balloons + volunteers]

** Lecture 5 **

[- Demonstration of impedance of capacitor/resistor using people running]
- Ran out of time to cover structural aspects of ferroelectric
    - Perhaps took too long on impedance question
- "Circuit" demonstration well-received, but not sure that covered the most difficult aspects
- Might be difficult to get enough volunteers; male-dominated
- Need to highlight the distinction between individual frequency-time measurement and series of frequencies on plots
- 

** Lecture 6**

[- Demonstration with sheep and cows as defect clusters]
- Perfect timing to cover final slides of L5 and all of L6 (i.e. too short)
- First part of examples/definitions is very boring!
    - Is there opportunity to add a quiz?
    - How to focus on the structure-property behaviour, rather than engineering controls?
- Sheep farming demo works quite well, although slow to modify on a document camera
- Would be good to clarify how brownmillerite-perovskite transition looks (jmol?)

# General comments
- Remove slide transitions when generating PDF (can this be automated with git commits?)
- Mentimeter quizzes don't automatically update
    - This can be useful to hide other student's answers...
- Is there a way to link the Mentimeter number with the previous slide contents?
    - Otherwise there is no way to start the vote without showing the answers
- Multiple people told me in person how much they enjoyed the lectures!
    - Interactive demos definitely make it more fun


## Comments from Assessment

- Highlight that radius ratios don't work for fluorite materials (and others); emphasise that predicting structures is tough!

2022-23
-------

**Lecture 1**
- Perfect timing
- Needs more time devoted to explaining close packing and holes
	- Perspex balls in a box works well in small groups, but didn't appear well on the visualiser
	- Better animation/interactive demo?
- Consider removing spacegroup references to avoid confusion?

	
** Lecture 2**

- Overran, but probably due to close packing demo at the start
- Quiz 2 needs quite a lot of time to complete
	- Make sure to be clear on the answer in advance!
- Can (should) it be made clear why Ag interstitial in AgCl is 4-coordinate?
- IS defect ordering section required?

** Lecture 3**

- Overran slightly due to finishing off Lecture 2 (defect ordering)
- Too much time discussing conduction pathways
	- Need a way to distribute 'good' techniques without giving the answers away

** Lecture 4**

- Overran by almost 5 mins; too much material
- Boring lecture with lots of examples
	- Can I add a demonstration/interactive thing?
	- Too many examples/definitions; can anything be dropped?
- Galvanostats still not useful

** Lecture 5**
- Consider adding interactive 3D plot of Z',Z" and f to make relationship clear
- Conceptual understanding of capacitance phase shift remains tough
- 

** Lecture 6**
- Well-timed
- Needs some degree of interactivity
	- Ordering of defects in class?
- Quite dry - can the key points be got across without so many examples?!
	
**Tutorial**

- Too many questions	
    - Students get slowed down by the number crunching of Q2; could we remove/simplify the charge storage calculation?
	- Although interesting, the oxidation/reduction question could be reduced in size/removed (not totally relevant?)
- Leave more time to go through structure visualisation/packing hunting. Can students do this in the tutorial themselves with support?
- Tutorial Qs do not fully reflect the assessment questions in places
    - Should they?
    - Can more guidance be given around the assessment?

**General Improvements**

- Many students struggle with visualising close-packing. Make more use of the PhysChem ball models?
- Wide concern over impedance spectroscopy; should it be chopped?!
- Add in the observation that every octahedral hole shares its faces with tetrahedral holes for CCP, and show same
  idea for HCP
- Demonstrate partially-occupied sites more completely, perhaps using fuel cell or battery lecture examples?



	

2021-22
-------

- Lecture 2 overran; either too much content or too long spent on tasks
- Lecture 4 too packed; not enough time to consider galvanostatic measurements and meaning
	- Maybe drop galvanostats altogether?!
- Too much maths/physics in lecture 5
	- Direct more towards the chemistry and applications, with less number-crunching
- Put more chemistry in lecture 6?
- Tutorial is too long for 1 hour (esp. PGT); remove Q3 next time

Comments
- Mentimeters appreciated by students, but don't spend too long
- Interactive structures are good
	- Can I customise the right-click menu to allow easy polyhedra and bonds on/off?
