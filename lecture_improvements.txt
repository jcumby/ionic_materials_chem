Lecture improvements still to do...
===================================

2022-23
-------

**Lecture 1**
- Perfect timing
- Needs more time devoted to explaining close packing and holes
	- Perspex balls in a box works well in small groups, but didn't appear well on the visualiser
	- Better animation/interactive demo?
- Consider removing spacegroup references to avoid confusion?

	
** Lecture 2**

- Overran, but probably due to close packing demo at the start
- Quiz 2 needs quite a lot of time to complete
	- Make sure to be clear on the answer in advance!
- Can (should) it be made clear why Ag interstitial in AgCl is 4-coordinate?
- IS defect ordering section required?

** Lecture 3**

- Overran slightly due to finishing off Lecture 2 (defect ordering)
- Too much time discussing conduction pathways
	- Need a way to distribute 'good' techniques without giving the answers away

** Lecture 4**

- Overran by almost 5 mins; too much material
- Boring lecture with lots of examples
	- Can I add a demonstration/interactive thing?
	- Too many examples/definitions; can anything be dropped?
- Galvanostats still not useful

** Lecture 5**
- Consider adding interactive 3D plot of Z',Z" and f to make relationship clear
- Conceptual understanding of capacitance phase shift remains tough
- 

** Lecture 6**
- Well-timed
- Needs some degree of interactivity
	- Ordering of defects in class?
- Quite dry - can the key points be got across without so many examples?!
	
**Tutorial**

- Too many questions	
    - Students get slowed down by the number crunching of Q2; could we remove/simplify the charge storage calculation?
	- Although interesting, the oxidation/reduction question could be reduced in size/removed (not totally relevant?)
- Leave more time to go through structure visualisation/packing hunting. Can students do this in the tutorial themselves with support?
- Tutorial Qs do not fully reflect the assessment questions in places
    - Should they?
    - Can more guidance be given around the assessment?

**General Improvements**

- Many students struggle with visualising close-packing. Make more use of the PhysChem ball models?
- Wide concern over impedance spectroscopy; should it be chopped?!
- Add in the observation that every octahedral hole shares its faces with tetrahedral holes for CCP, and show same
  idea for HCP
- Demonstrate partially-occupied sites more completely, perhaps using fuel cell or battery lecture examples?



	

2021-22
-------

- Lecture 2 overran; either too much content or too long spent on tasks
- Lecture 4 too packed; not enough time to consider galvanostatic measurements and meaning
	- Maybe drop galvanostats altogether?!
- Too much maths/physics in lecture 5
	- Direct more towards the chemistry and applications, with less number-crunching
- Put more chemistry in lecture 6?
- Tutorial is too long for 1 hour (esp. PGT); remove Q3 next time

Comments
- Mentimeters appreciated by students, but don't spend too long
- Interactive structures are good
	- Can I customise the right-click menu to allow easy polyhedra and bonds on/off?

- Lecture 2:
    - Slide 4; add better arrows
- Lecture 3:
    - Better arrows on electrolytes slide
