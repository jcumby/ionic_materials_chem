Lecture improvements still to do...
===================================

2021-22
-------

- Lecture 2 overran; either too much content or too long spent on tasks
- Lecture 4 too packed; not enough time to consider galvanostatic measurements and meaning
	- Maybe drop galvanostats altogether?!
- Too much maths/physics in lecture 5
	- Direct more towards the chemistry and applications, with less number-crunching
- Put more chemistry in lecture 6?
- Tutorial is too long for 1 hour (esp. PGT); remove Q3 next time

Comments
- Mentimeters appreciated by students, but don't spend too long
- Interactive structures are good
	- Can I customise the right-click menu to allow easy polyhedra and bonds on/off?
